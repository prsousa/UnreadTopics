# Unread Topics

This is a Google Chrome extension developed to try to help the users (including myself) of a SMF Forum.

The main feature is to automatically fetch and open the unread posts in different tabs.
In addition, users can upload images into their posts with a simple copy-paste.

At lunchtime, the canteen menu can also be consulted.


## Features

* Subscribe to new posts updates (GCM/FCM)
* Fetch and open unread topics
	* Key shortcuts
	* Sidebar injected on forum
	* Icon popup page
* Search for topics by name
* Sync personal settings with Google Account
* Display preview of images/GIFs/videos from their URLs
* Sync/display canteen month menus
